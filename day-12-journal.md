Day 12 Journal – A-Level Study Assistant Project
Date: 2025-05-16

✅ What I Accomplished:
Ran and tested my working app.py prototype from GitHub

Successfully loaded system-prompt.txt in Colab

Wrapped the assistant logic in a reusable function

Created a working input-response loop using input() for live Q&A

Verified assistant handles scientific follow-ups like Ampere's Law

🛠 Notes:
Needed to re-run system-prompt.txt write block due to Colab session reset

Re-entered API key manually (expected with Colab)

Assistant is performing well — helpful, structured answers for Edexcel topics

🧠 Reflection:
The loop makes testing feel more natural and interactive. This step made the assistant feel “real.” Follow-up questions still work, though true multi-turn memory isn’t implemented yet — that’ll be next.

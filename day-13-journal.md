 Day 13 Journal – Re-entry & Reset
Date: 2025-05-30
Status: Back in the game 🎯

✅ What I Did:
Reviewed all files in the a-level-agent/prototype/ folder

Re-read app.py and streamlit_app.py

Revisited past journal entries to refresh context

Opened my Colab notebook and tested a new prompt: “What is Newton’s Third Law?”

Reconnected with my assistant’s purpose and system prompt
🧠 Reflections:
It’s amazing how quickly details can fade after a break — but also how quickly it all comes back once you dive in. I feel ready to move forward and start deploying the app publicly via Streamlit Cloud next.
🔜 Next Step:
👉 Deploy the assistant using Streamlit Cloud and create a public link.
